				I am Nalin_C(aka NLN), a creative developer, machine-learning junkie and FOSS evangelist. I love working at /src and constantly try to bridge the gap between the technology, design and human experience by building great products. When not coding, I either watch movies, tv series or play chess.  
				<p>
					Inspired and impassioned by experiencing new things, I adore programming, take it very seriously and constantly seek to improve upon myself. I have learned to appreciate the value of what I have in life and what I do with it. I am passionate about understanding and learning how users respond to situations, systems and applications in order to better develop new technology that will meet their needs. I have a strong inclination towards
					<b>information retrieval</b>, <b>visualization</b> and <b>interface design</b> with 
					essence of <b>machine learning</b>.  If you find something related interesting, please come and talk to me!
